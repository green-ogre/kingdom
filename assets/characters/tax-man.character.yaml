        Your Majesty, we've had difficulty collecting dues from the West Duchy. I suggest that a stiff fine be levied. If we are unable to collect this, too, then perhaps a show of force is appropriate.
      # So this isn't exactly "good or bad." Maybe we can have morally ambiguous choices from time to time?
      yes:
        heart_size: -1
        wealth: 10
        last_word: Excellent news.
      no:
        heart_size: 1
        last_word: Yes, You Majesty.
